Users should be able to:

- You have got 4 hours to complete this challenge, so try to reach as much perfection as possible for this challenge!
- Try to implement the design below, using only React and Tailwindcss,
- Use tailwind as much as possible. Only use custom CSS when you absolutely have to. In that case, structure your custom CSS in BEM.
- When you start the project, immediately create a "development" branch where you will do all your coding,
